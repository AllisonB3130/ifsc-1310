        <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
        <p>I asked my friend group online for feedback on my website. Although none of them have any practice with web design, a good chunk of them are artists. I thought they would be a good choice since they didn't know anything about web design, and wouldn't shy away from giving me advice they thought was too hard. Their added artistic knowledge would help me with my colour scheme and other design choices.</p>
        <p>The advice they gave me was that the logo for SpaceX and Dragon was not visible enough, mostly because the header background was too busy. I was also told a lot of my colors were leaning very purple, I'm colourblind so that was to be expected. They also had told me to look for a different font, as the one I had before looked similar to ariel and did not fit the feel of the webpage.</p>
        <p>In response to their critique, I went through and created a new color palette. I based it off of the SpaceX and Dragon logos, which I probably should have done from the start since those are the brand colors. I changed the header to a gradient and added a white border around both the SpaceX and Dragon logos so that they would be easier to see. I moved the original background to be the background of the webpage just to still have the technology reference, but have it not be in the way. I did some tweaking to font sizes and some of the layout, just to make things look prettier and be more readable.</p>
        
        <h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
        <p>This semester has been quite the learning experience for me. Both in this class specifically, and as a whole. A lot of what I learned doesn't relate to web design at all, but rather at my ability to communicate and my own work ethics. I've learned that I need to work on communicating better and that unlike highschool, I am not as easily able to catch up on my work when I get sick. And even if I am, it doesn't erase the possibilty that I get sick again. Because of that, I need to start telling people the day I get sick, rather than after when it starts causing problems.</p>
        <p>As for what I learned that relates specifically to web design, or rather coding as a whole, learning a new language is not as daunting as it seems. It always feels overwhelming at the start and like none of it will ever make sense, but once you start to work with it everything starts to make sense. It just takes a lot of playing around. You pretty much have to stick with it until it makes sense, and even then you'll sometimes do something and have no clue why it worked.</p>
        <p>What I would say I did well was applying my own knowledge of art and graphic design to this course. That previous background knowledge helped me in creating websites that looked at least somewhat cohesieve and partially decent. I would also say that I did well with quickly understanding the concepts and putting them into practice. If I could start this semester over, I'd work on communicating better. I'd do a better job on trying to organise my work so that if I do get behind, catching up isn't such a daunting task. Even in general, I need to keep better track of due dates and have a plan for how I'm going to work on my assignments. I've had a bad habit of putting everything off until the last minute. That may have worked in highschool, but it just doesn't work out with college.</p>
