            <h2>Cats</h2>
            <p>Cat, (Felis catus), domesticated member (felid) of the family Felidae. The family is generally divided between cats from the subfamily Pantherinae, which roar (including lions, tigers, and leopards), and cats from the subfamily Felinae, which purr instead (including cougars, bobcats, and domestic cats). According to the latest research, purring likely stems from a special pad within the folds of a cat’s vocal cords, which adds an additional layer of fatty tissue that enables the folds to vibrate (purr) at low frequencies. Domestic cats are characterized by retractable claws, powerful bodies, acute senses, long tails, and specialized teeth adapted for hunting prey.</p>
            <p>The following article deals with general characteristics of the <em>domestic cat</em>. For information on larger cats, see their individual entries (such as lion, tiger, and leopard). For information on housing the domestic cat, see cats as pets. For an account of the relationship of the cat family to other carnivores, see carnivore.</p>

            <h3>Identifying Cats</h3>
            <p>Cats can be identified by their base colors, patterns and fur type. Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hair length:</strong> shorthair, longhair, or mediumhair</li>
                <li><strong>Color:</strong> orange, brown, black, grey, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Patterns:</strong> tabby, bi color, tri color, color point, etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Breeds</h3>
            <p>Development of cat breeds started in the mid 19th century. An analysis of the domestic cat genome revealed that the ancestral wildcat genome was significantly altered in the process of domestication, as specific mutations were selected to develop cat breeds. Most breeds are founded on random-bred domestic cats. Genetic diversity of these breeds varies between regions, and is lowest in purebred populations, which show more than 20 deleterious genetic disorders.</p>

            <h5>What's a Domestic non-pedigreed cat?</h5>
            <p>Domestic non-pedigreed cats are the felines often found outdoors and in rescues, which are not considered an intentionally bred breed. These cats (also known as companion cats or household cats) date back to the days of Pharaohs. Although these cats were targeted during the witch hunts of the 1500s and 1600s, they survived and eventually gained favor in people’s hearts and homes again.</p>
            <p>Domestic non-pedigreed cats all look different with varying personalities and temperaments, hair colors and styles, activity levels and features. Like their pedigreed counterparts, these cats are allowed to participate in shows.</p>
          
            <h3>Why do people like cats?</h3>
            <p>There are many different reasons, but people tend to like cats because of how independent they are. They can be quite friendly at times, but are also ok keeping to themselves and don't want constant attention. Cats also tend to be quieter than most other pets, only meowing when they're hungry. There are some exceptions of course. Cats are also low maintenance as they don't need training, walking, and constant attention.</p>
